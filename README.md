Sample Coming soon page in Node.js with timer. Just give a timestamp and you will have a countdown until that timestamp.

Clone the repo.

Install dependency with npn install.

Make changes to the public/index.html file.

All files in public/* are accessible to the web site.

Find the unit timestamp that you want for the final time. Look at sites like this:  https://www.unixtimestamp.com

Edit the file index.html.

Search for data-end-sec and set it to the Unix Time for the end date you want.

For example: 
data-end-sec="1579161600"
